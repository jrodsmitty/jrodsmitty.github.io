I have the pleasure of being a guest on Episode 7 of the [Sitecore Experienced! podcast](http://www.sitecoreexperienced.com). In this episode, I discuss our team's Sitecore workflow from coding all the way out into Azure Paas.

Not many companies choose to use Azure PaaS, but instead choose IaaS because it's easier to manage. However, once you get things working on PaaS, over time you will reap the benefits of an automatically-updated/patched hosting environment.
