On many occasions over the last nine years I have found myself facing all flavors of weird browser quirks, software quirks, and many other head-bashing frustrations.  Had I had the forethought to document all the solutions to my problems as they occurred, I might already have helped many others outside my immediate dev team avoid the same frustrations I/we had.

My hope for this blog is that I do just that - share my frustrations, learnings, and solutions to all sorts of problems I face on a daily basis, with practical, working examples that you can actually use to solve your problems.

Per my experience and interests, I'd categorize myself as a hybrid (Front-End / Back-End) developer. I have worked at a number of digital marketing agencies over the years, working with a wide variety of tools.  To name just a few: ColdFusion, Perl, the LAMP stack, Flash / ActionScript 3, Flex, C#.NET, SQL Server, Kentico CMS, Sitecore CMS, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and many others.  My latest escapades bring me to C#.NET MVC (w/ Razor, of course!) and Sitecore CMS.  Many of my posts will focus on Sitecore development, but I plan to branch off from time to time to venture into other topics as well.

I hope you find some useful nuggets in my blog.  Happy coding!
