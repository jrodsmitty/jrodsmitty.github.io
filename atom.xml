    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever since we first installed Sitecore 7.2 rev. 140228 (first release), we have noticed an odd visual bug in Page Editor. We have since uninstall/reinstalled to be at the latest release: 7.2 rev. 140526. However, we still see the issue. There appears to be a small rectangular &ldquo;knock-out&rdquo; overlaying the bottom edge of the &ldquo;Add to here&rdquo; button. I was able to track it down to the &ldquo;webedit.css&rdquo; file in the root /Website folder where Sitecore is installed.</p>

<p>In the webedit.css file, line 604, I changed &ldquo;height: 11px;&rdquo; to &ldquo;height: 24px;&rdquo; and that fixed the issue.</p>

<h2>UPDATE (11/6/14)</h2>

<p>I contacted Sitecore support about this bug, and they weren&rsquo;t able to reproduce the issue with a clean install of 7.2. I thought that was kind of odd, since I have also noticed the bug during a demo of Sitecore 8 at the Milwaukee Sitecore Meetup group. The presenter was demoing the Experience Editor (previously Page Editor), and lo and behold, there it was!</p>

<p>After sending more information to Sitecore support, it turns out that the issue was/is caused by using &ldquo;border-box&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;content-box&rdquo; on some of their UI elements. We are using Bootstrap, which via its styles, was applying &ldquo;content-box&rdquo; to the element with the &ldquo;.scInsertionHandleCenter&rdquo; class.</p>

<p>The two recommended solution(s) from Sitecore are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove box-sizing: border-box for * or div from site.min.css if possible.</li>
<li>Add the following style in your site&rsquo;s design CSS:</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>.scInsertionHandleCenter 
</span><span class='line'>{
</span><span class='line'>  box-sizing: content-box !important;
</span><span class='line'>  -webkit-box-sizing: content-box !important; 
</span><span class='line'>  -moz-box-sizing: content-box !important; 
</span><span class='line'> }</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On many occasions over the last nine years I have found myself facing all flavors of weird browser quirks, software quirks, and many other head-bashing frustrations. Had I had the forethought to document all the solutions to my problems as they occurred, I might already have helped many others outside my immediate dev team avoid the same frustrations I/we had.</p>

<p>My hope for this blog is that I do just that - share my frustrations, learnings, and solutions to all sorts of problems I face on a daily basis, with practical, working examples that you can actually use to solve your problems.</p>

<p>Per my experience and interests, I&rsquo;d categorize myself as a hybrid (Front-End / Back-End) developer. I have worked at a number of digital marketing agencies over the years, working with a wide variety of tools, and have gained some training/certifications along the way too (both a Kentico and Sitecore certified developer). My latest escapades bring me to C#.NET MVC (w/ Razor, of course!) and Sitecore CMS. Many of my posts will focus on Sitecore development, but I plan to branch off from time to time to venture into other topics as well.</p>

<p>I hope you find some useful nuggets in my blog. Happy coding!</p>
