<p>Ever since we first installed Sitecore 7.2 rev. 140228 (first release), we have noticed an odd visual bug in Page Editor. We have since uninstall/reinstalled to be at the latest release: 7.2 rev. 140526. However, we still see the issue. There appears to be a small rectangular &ldquo;knock-out&rdquo; overlaying the bottom edge of the &ldquo;Add to here&rdquo; button. I was able to track it down to the &ldquo;webedit.css&rdquo; file in the root /Website folder where Sitecore is installed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/add-here-bug.png" title="[100%] [auto] [Page Editor Bug [Page Editor Bug]]" ></p>

<p>In the webedit.css file, line 604, I changed &ldquo;height: 11px;&rdquo; to &ldquo;height: 24px;&rdquo; and that fixed the issue.</p>

<h3>UPDATE (11/6/14)</h3>

<p>I contacted Sitecore support about this bug, and they weren&rsquo;t able to reproduce the issue with a clean install of 7.2. I thought that was kind of odd, since I have also noticed the bug during a demo of Sitecore 8 at the Milwaukee Sitecore Meetup group. The presenter was demoing the Experience Editor (previously Page Editor), and lo and behold, there it was!</p>

<p>After sending more information to Sitecore support, it turns out that the issue was/is caused by using &ldquo;border-box&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;content-box&rdquo; on some of their UI elements. We are using Bootstrap, which via its styles, was applying &ldquo;content-box&rdquo; to the element with the &ldquo;.scInsertionHandleCenter&rdquo; class.</p>

<p>The two recommended solution(s) from Sitecore are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove box-sizing: border-box for * or div from site.min.css if possible.</li>
<li>Add the following style in your site&rsquo;s design CSS:
<code>
 .scInsertionHandleCenter
 {
   box-sizing: content-box !important;
   -webkit-box-sizing: content-box !important;
   -moz-box-sizing: content-box !important;
  }
</code></li>
</ol>
