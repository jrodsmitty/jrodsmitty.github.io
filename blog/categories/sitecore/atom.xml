    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I recently released my first module on the Sitecore Marketplace. It&rsquo;s a super-simple, highly portable Facebook Like Button MVC View Rendering (<a href="https://marketplace.sitecore.net/Modules/Facebook_Like_Button.aspx">https://marketplace.sitecore.net/Modules/Facebook_Like_Button.aspx</a>).</p></blockquote>

<h2>I Started By Setting Some Ground Rules</h2>

<p>For this exercise, I laid out a couple ground rules for myself, so I could actually finish something. Like many developers, I add some features, refactor, add some more stuff, set it aside awhile, forget about it, and then when I come back to it, it&rsquo;s not relevant anymore and I scrap it. These are the rules I set for myself.</p>

<h3>1. Choosing something easy (but annoying) to implement every time it&rsquo;s needed</h3>

<p>I often get asked to include a Facebook Like button in the footer of a site. Sure, it&rsquo;s a copy and paste thing, but it&rsquo;s still mind-numbing work, and it&rsquo;s still not editable by a content author. It would be nice to have it editable (and translatable for a multi-site setup so you can have a different &ldquo;like&rdquo; url for different languages, for instance).</p>

<h3>2. Following the KISS principle</h3>

<p>Since there was so little logic with the solution for this, I really didn&rsquo;t feel it warranted putting the logic in a Controller or storing the field values in a Model, which would have generated an output .dll. This decision had the side benefit of allowing a developer to easily modify the code if needed, since  all the logic lives in the .cshtml file itself in the /Views folder.</p>

<h3>3. Setting a deadline</h3>

<p>Due to many half-done and forgotton pet projects in my past, I chose to give myself a tight deadline so I would be forced to manage scope. I work well against tight deadlines at work, so why would I tend to be so extreme the opposite for personal projects? I chose a limit of 8 hours or less for this.</p>

<h3>4. Submitting to the Marketplace</h3>

<p>The submission process was easy. You give a name to your module, add a description, some screenshots, documentation as needed, upload your .zip package file, and you&rsquo;re done. Then a Sitecore employee tests your module, and once they confirm it works as advertised, they approve and publish it. Not too complicated.</p>

<h3>Completed</h3>

<p>At the end of the day, that module does only one thing really well, but it met all the criteria I had laid out. I got my feet wet, and know what to expect next time.</p>

    <link href="http://jrodsmitty.github.io/blog/2014/11/12/resolving-jquery-conflicts-in-page-editor/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-12T19:49:03-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jrodsmitty.github.io/blog/2014/11/12/resolving-jquery-conflicts-in-page-editor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the current project I&rsquo;m working on, we are using Bootstrap&rsquo;s &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; functionality (<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse">http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse</a>) for some of our components. Our requirements dictate that all accordions on the page be in the collapsed state, so in &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; mode of Page Editor, we&rsquo;d like them all expanded for ease of editing. The easiest way to accomplish this is to check for the PageMode, and execute some JQuery code to .collapse(&lsquo;show&rsquo;) all accordions on the page.</p>

<p>This seems like a fairly simple task (assuming we know JQuery decently well), but we run into some issues because our page&rsquo;s layout is using JQuery 2.1.1, but Sitecore loads JQuery 1.10.2 when using Page Editor, so we run into a JQuery version conflict, and in our case, all our calls to $(element).on(&lsquo;click&rsquo;, function() {..}) fail, because 1.10.2 doesn&rsquo;t support the .on() method.</p>

<h2>There are a couple ways to deal with this:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Give up using a different version of JQuery, and just include and use version 1.10.2 throughout the site.</li>
<li>Utilize JQuery.noConflict() and some other tricks to get things to work with version 2.1.1.</li>
</ol>


<p>We really wanted to use version 2.x of JQuery since our project requirements let us ignore (for the most part) older browsers, and all the code-bloat in JQuery 1.x that handles older browser quirks for browsers like Internet Explorer has been removed in v2. So for our situation, we chose to go with option 2.</p>

<p>Page Editor loads its version of JQuery after we do during the page rendering (ours is within the head tag), so by the time we call our JQuery code, the global &ldquo;JQuery&rdquo; object now represents the older 1.10.2 version instead of 2.1.1, so our code throws the error &ldquo;Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Here was our solution:</h3>

<p><em>NOTE: We&rsquo;re using an MVC view for our component</em></p>

<ol>
<li>LINE 17: To combat this &ldquo;re-defining&rdquo; of JQuery version, we first re-include our version of JQuery if we&rsquo;re in Preview Mode.</li>
<li>LINE 23: We add our code using a re-scoped variable for the global &ldquo;jQuery&rdquo; object.</li>
<li>LINE 49: In active &ldquo;editing&rdquo; mode, we force all accordions to stay expanded, otherwise they function normally.</li>
</ol>


<p>Although it feels dirty re-including jquery like this, if you really need to be using a different version of JQuery other than what Sitecore includes, this is (at least one) workable way to accomplish that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever since we first installed Sitecore 7.2 rev. 140228 (first release), we have noticed an odd visual bug in Page Editor. We have since uninstall/reinstalled to be at the latest release: 7.2 rev. 140526. However, we still see the issue. There appears to be a small rectangular &ldquo;knock-out&rdquo; overlaying the bottom edge of the &ldquo;Add to here&rdquo; button. I was able to track it down to the &ldquo;webedit.css&rdquo; file in the root /Website folder where Sitecore is installed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/add-here-bug.png" title="[100%] [auto] [Page Editor Bug [Page Editor Bug]]" ></p>

<p>In the webedit.css file, line 604, I changed &ldquo;height: 11px;&rdquo; to &ldquo;height: 24px;&rdquo; and that fixed the issue.</p>

<p><img src="/images/add-here-bug-fixed.png" title="[100%] [auto] [Page Editor Bug Fix [Page Editor Bug Fix]]" ></p>

<h3>UPDATE (11/6/14)</h3>

<p>I contacted Sitecore support about this bug, and they weren&rsquo;t able to reproduce the issue with a clean install of 7.2. I thought that was kind of odd, since I have also noticed the bug during a demo of Sitecore 8 at the Milwaukee Sitecore Meetup group. The presenter was demoing the Experience Editor (previously Page Editor), and lo and behold, there it was!</p>

<p>After sending more information to Sitecore support, it turns out that the issue was/is caused by using &ldquo;border-box&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;content-box&rdquo; on some of their UI elements. We are using Bootstrap, which via its styles, was applying &ldquo;content-box&rdquo; to the element with the &ldquo;.scInsertionHandleCenter&rdquo; class.</p>

<p>The two recommended solution(s) from Sitecore are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove box-sizing: border-box for * or div from site.min.css if possible.</li>
<li>Add the following style in your site&rsquo;s design CSS:
<code>
 .scInsertionHandleCenter
 {
   box-sizing: content-box !important;
   -webkit-box-sizing: content-box !important;
   -moz-box-sizing: content-box !important;
  }
</code></li>
</ol>
